# Cloud-Based IoT System with Virtual Sensors

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) system designed to collect environmental data from virtual sensors. The system utilizes the MQTT protocol for communication and integrates with the Thingspeak platform for data storage and visualization.

## Features
- Collects environmental data (temperature, humidity, CO2) from virtual sensors.
- Communicates with the Thingspeak platform via MQTT for data upload.
- Provides real-time monitoring and visualization of environmental data.
- Suitable for deployment on MicroPython-enabled devices.

## Getting Started
To use this IoT system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-system.git
   cd iot-system
## Configuration

1. Modify the `config.py` file to customize MQTT broker details, Thingspeak credentials, and Wi-Fi settings.
2. Ensure the MicroPython environment is set up properly on your device.

## Deploy the Code

1. Upload the Python scripts (`main.py`, `config.py`) to your MicroPython-enabled device.

## Run the Code

1. Execute the `main.py` script on your MicroPython device to start collecting and uploading sensor data.

## Dependencies

- MicroPython libraries
- `umqtt.simple` for MQTT communication
- `network` for Wi-Fi connectivity

## Usage

1. Ensure the MicroPython device is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.
2. The device will continuously collect sensor data and upload it to Thingspeak at regular intervals.
3. Access the Thingspeak platform to visualize and analyze the collected data.
